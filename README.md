# Vaadin Portlet Starter Project
Project to get started with a Vaadin application that is running inside a 
portlet in a portal based on the Java Portlet API 3.0. The starter has been tested
with Pluto Portal 3.1.0.
Clone the repository and import the project to the IDE of your choice as a Maven
project. You need to have Java 8 or 11 installed.

## Running the portlet

Before the portlet application can be run, it must be deployed to a portal. 
We currently support Apache Pluto (https://portals.apache.org/pluto/). The
easiest way to try out your application is to run a Maven goal which starts an 
embedded Tomcat 8 serving the Pluto Portal driver:

`mvn package cargo:run -Pdemo,production`

Visit http://localhost:8080/pluto, and log in as `pluto`, password `pluto`.

The deployed portlet needs to be added to portal page. Do this by
1) Selecting `Pluto Admin` page
2) Select `About Apache Pluto` from the drop-down under "Portal Pages"
3) Select `/portlet-starter` from the left drop-down under "Portlet Applications"
4) Select `MyPortlet1` from the drop-down on the right
5) Click the `Add Portlet` button

Once you navigate to `About Apache Pluto` page, the starter portlet should be
visible on the page, displaying a "Click me" button. 

## Remote debugging for Portal

Remote debugging (JDWP) is available on port 8000 (to activate
in IntelliJ, choose `Run -> Attach to Process...`). 

## Integration tests
To run the integration tests:

`mvn clean verify -Pdemo,production,integration-tests` 

## Production build
Before deploying your portlet for production for the first time, you will
probably want to change `portlet-name` in `portal.xml` from `TestPortlet1` to
something else, as well as the tag returned by `MyPortlet.PORTLET_TAG` from
`portlet-content` to something else (stock Pluto already contains portlets with
these names). Then build the production .war:

`mvn package -Pproduction`

Copy both `portlet-starter.war` and `vaadin-portlet-static.war` from `/target`
folder into the `webapps` folder on a Tomcat web server with Pluto. Restart
the web server. To add the portlet to a page, use Pluto's "Pluto Admin" 
interface as detailed in "Running the portlet".

## Portlet development in servlet mode

It is possible to develop portlets as normal single route Vaadin applications.

[NOTE] when developing using servlet mode no Portlet specific methods can be used
in the view for servlet mode. 

To develop portlets in servlet mode using jetty create a Route for portlet content e.g.

```java
package com.vaadin.starter.portlet;

import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route("")
public class ServletDevelopment extends MyPortletContent {
}
```

Then run the project as `mvn clean jetty:run -Pservlet`

### Creating a Portlet with servlet mode

To create an application that can be used both as a portlet and a servlet application
you need to check at generation time the `Request` type.

For instance `MyPortletContent` could be setup as

```java
public class MyPortletContent extends VerticalLayout {
    public MyPortletContent() {
        String message;
        if (VaadinRequest.getCurrent() instanceof PortletRequest) {
            VaadinPortlet portlet = VaadinPortlet.getCurrent();
            String name = portlet.getPortletName();
            String serverInfo = portlet.getPortletContext().getServerInfo();
            message = String
                    .format("Hello from %s running in %s!", name, serverInfo);
        } else {
            message = String
                    .format("Hello from %s running in a servlet container",
                            getClass().getSimpleName());
        }
        Button button = new Button("Click me",
                event -> Notification.show(message));
        add(button);
    }
}
```

## Notes about the project

Vaadin 14+ portlet support feature is still under development and changes to
both the API and this starter project are possible.
